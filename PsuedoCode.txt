Gravitational Force = G*M1*M2 / d^2
Gravitational Acceleration of a planet = GM / r^2
G-Force = Great movie about gerbils ft. Nicolas Cage
Orbital Speed Equation = âˆš(G * M1 / r) 
Orbital Period Equation = (T^2)/(R^3) = (4 * pi^2)/GM

G = gravitational constant (6.673 x 10^-11 Nm^2/kg^2)
M1, M2 = mass of the planet
d = distance between planets
r = radius of planet
T = period of the satellite
R = average radius of orbit
